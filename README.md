# Co-migration of hundreds of species over metres drives selection and promotes non-motile hitchhikers

Code used to generate figures for the paper 'Co-migration of hundreds of species over metres drives selection and promotes non-motile hitchhikers' by Grigson et. al 

## How-to-use
Raw sequencing files can be obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, BioProject number PRJNA788639. Sample accession numbers range from SRR30661426-SRR30661458 for 16S sequencing from SRR17326388-SRR17326409 for the long-term migration experiments and from SRR29503425-SRR29503452 for the residual community experiments. Data was processed using scripts from the atavide pipeline https://github.com/linsalrob/atavide_lite. </br> 

Intermediate files and output are available [here](https://figshare.com/s/953b050065ca18fae420). Files should be unpacked into the `data` directory to allow generation of figures and statistics in the `code` directory. The notebook `curves_rank_abundance.ipynb` should be run first to generate the output files needed to generate ordination plots. Similarly, the code in `filter_hecatomb.ipynb` should be run before `virus_heatmaps_ordination.R` and `DeSeq2.R` should be run before `chemotaxis.ipynb`. Each script should take only a few minutes to run and has been tested on a Apple M2 Macbook Pro, 16GB RAM. Expected output is included in the `output_files` directory. 

## Data-Processing details 
Data downloaded from figshare has already been processed and these steps are not required to run code. All data processing was run on the Flinders University Deepthought HPC - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.10 (Ootpa)
